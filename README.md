# CSS-Practice-Site

all the pathing is not going to be accurate when you download the files. You'll need to download the images, the icons, and make the pathing make sense for the code
if you wanna see how it ends up turning out. The preview isn't going to look good either because, obviously since the pathing is wrong, the CSS wont be applied.

Best of luck :)
